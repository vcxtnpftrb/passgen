# passgen

This is a password generator made with C and a lot of help from chatGPT

You can run it and enter the length of the password into the prompt, or you can run it with the --length=N paramater to specify a desired length without the prompt. 

You can do as you please with this code, it exists purely for my own convinience. 

It can be helpful to place the executable in /usr/local/bin to run it directly from the terminal from anywhere, eg - "sudo mv passgen /usr/local/bin/passgen"

Enjoy!
